I decided to take a day off "work" and have some fun. My kind of fun is probably not the same as most people....

So, I built a Chrome extension that shows you a different quasi-random book each time you open a new tab in Chrome. The books are pulled from the recent books in each Channel on Bookship / The Hawaii Project, so they aren't completely random, they're books somebody is talking about on the web right now.

You can install it here: [Book Roulette](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/book-roulette-by-bookship/nmomlgnkllppccohkeemlenohnakehoc?hl=en), or just go search the Chrome webstore. It's free. If you click through to Amazon or Bookshop and buy a book, we get a small commission.

Give Book Roulette a spin! (haha!).
