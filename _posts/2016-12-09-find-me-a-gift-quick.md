Few things make better gifts than a thoughtfully chosen, personalized book.

But finding great, unique books has always been a challenge. It’s hard enough to find great books for yourself. Somebody else? Fugetaboutit!

But no longer. Introducing The Hawaii Project’s Personalized Book Gift Finder. A few quick taps on our unique channels, or a quick entry of your giftee’s interests, and Presto! Great, unique, curated book recommendations.

Here’s a quick screenshot. You can choose from a rotating carousel of interesting “channels”, or just enter in something your giftee is interested in, like “baseball”, “jazz”, or “quilting”. See a great book, tap out to Amazon, buy, send, done.
