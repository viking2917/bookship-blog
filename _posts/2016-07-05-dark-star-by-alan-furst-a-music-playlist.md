Here at [The Hawaii Project](http://www.thehawaiiproject.com), we love music almost as much as we love books. The experience of reading a great book, combined with appropriate music, can be transporting.

We’re currently reading Dark Star, by Alan Furst. Think Casablanca in pre-WWII Paris and Berlin. With a Russian Jewish spy, trapped in a closing net.

So, we built a soundtrack to go with the book. It’s filled with pre-war classic Jazz, and some of the music Furst himself pointed to as inspirations, including Barber’s classic Adagio for Strings. Enjoy!
