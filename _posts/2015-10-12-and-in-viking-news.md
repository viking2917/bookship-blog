Did you know that Bernard Cornwell’s wonderful Saxon Tales have been made into a series by the BBC? The first season is based on The Last Kingdom, and premiered Saturday night.

The first episode is awesome. There’s a touch of humor as a wordy priest nearly drowns Uthred while baptizing him, a touch of gore when Uthred’s older brother (the former Uthred)’s head is cut off and thrown at the feed of Uthred’s father, and some wonderful dragonship sailing. The series seems like it’s going to stay true to the novels and keep historical verisimilitude. Yay!
