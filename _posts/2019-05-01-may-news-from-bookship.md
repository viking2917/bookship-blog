Welcome to May from Bookship!

There's a new release of Bookship out. It includes some fun new Browse channels, and some important bug fixes (especially iOS). [Download it](https://www.bookshipapp.com/download) when you get a moment, for the best experience. (and if you're feeling it leave us a review in the App Store!)

I’ve recently gotten involved in the Indigenous Innovation community here in Hawaii. It’s about sustainable innovation in the context of the local community. Dr. Kiana Frank, a Molecular Biologist with a penchant for [teaching science through dance](https://www.instagram.com/labhuiofrank/), said something that really stuck with me. _"Innovation is the art of taking something ancient and making it modern."_. What is more ancient than sitting around the fire telling and listening to stories? We hope you're enjoying our modern version of sitting around the campfire.

**This month's tip**: Saving Books & your TBR. Bookship provides all kinds of cool ways to Browse Books: popular books, great books for book clubs, various genres, even what others are reading on Bookship. If you want to save something for later (your To Be Read list), just tap the bookmark icon (![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/d78cd73b-f407-4792-b658-510aa22fcc6c.jpg){:class="bookship-small-icon"}) on the top right of the page (we also moved the Background Reading button top right). It will turn green - to "unsave" it, just tap it again. Get back to your list using the Browse tab; pick the bookmark icon on the top right (or the "Saved Books" link in the Topical & Trendy section). Lastly we made it easier to start reading a book if we have the eBook - just click "Read Now" if the button is there.

The most popular books on Bookship in the last month are:

[Educated](https://www.amazon.com/Educated-Memoir-Tara-Westover-ebook/dp/B072BLVM83?SubscriptionId=AKIAIKMVYJ6MJU6ROZYQ&tag=codexmap-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B072BLVM83)

I've heard about this book from so many people. Tara Westover was born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho. She was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she’d traveled too far, if there was still a way home. This is non-fiction, folks.

[Frankenstein](https://www.amazon.com/Frankenstein-Mary-Shelley-ebook/dp/B00FDS85EC?SubscriptionId=AKIAIKMVYJ6MJU6ROZYQ&tag=codexmap-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00FDS85EC)

I'm guessing you know Frankenstein by reputation, even if you've never read it. Good news: with the new Bookship eReader, you can read Frankenstein for free, right in the browser (and do it with your friends). This month Frankenstein is pretty popular on Bookship; I'm guessing some of you have figured out you can read it for free!

[Daisy Jones & The Six](https://www.amazon.com/Daisy-Jones-Taylor-Jenkins-Reid/dp/1524798622?SubscriptionId=AKIAIKMVYJ6MJU6ROZYQ&tag=codexmap-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1524798622)

Who doesn't love a good rock and roll story? Taylor Jenkins Reid's new book tells the story of the rise (and fall?) of Daisy Jones, the lead singer of an iconic 1970s rock band. Reese Witherspoon said “I devoured Daisy Jones & The Six in a day, falling head over heels for it. Daisy and the band captured my heart.” - and picked it for her book club. This one is fiction, folks.

Thanks for reading and staying in touch. If you have any trouble with Bookship, please drop me a note!

Happy Reading!
