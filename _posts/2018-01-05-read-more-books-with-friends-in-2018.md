A great new year’s resolution is to read more/better books, especially in today’s age of distraction. I made a mobile app called [Bookship](https://www.bookshipapp.com) that helps you read more books with friends, family and co-workers. It’s free. I hope you can try it out in the new year — feedback very much welcome!
