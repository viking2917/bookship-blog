As part of my continuing experiment with Scribd’s ebook subscription service, I stumbled upon Scoundrel, by one of my favorite authors, [Bernard Cornwell](http://www.thehawaiiproject.com/books--written-by--Bernard-Cornwell). I know him from his great historical fiction - some of my favorites are the [Saxon Chronicles](http://www.thehawaiiproject.com/book/The-Last-Kingdom-%28The-Saxon-Chronicles-Series-1%29--by--Bernard-Cornwell--5692), his novel about [Agincour](http://www.thehawaiiproject.com/book/Agincourt--by--Bernard-Cornwell--5683)t and the [Thomas of Hookton Archer series](http://www.thehawaiiproject.com/book/The-Archers-Tale-%28The-Grail-Quest-Book-1%29--by--Bernard-Cornwell--5688). Who knew he’d written sailing novels?

Bostonian Paul Shanahan is a smuggler, an arms dealer, a suspected CIA agent, and a sailor. Now he’s agreed to haul $5M in gold across the ocean in a sailboat to help the IRA….Scoundrel is a kind of Patriot Games with Sailboats. Good fun. If you’re looking for a good airplane book, this’ll do the trick.

The first real “discovery” I had using Scribd, it found this book for me, and I thought I was aware of every book in Cornwell’s resume. While it’s nothing like as serious as his other works, it was good fun all the same and a pleasant discovery.
