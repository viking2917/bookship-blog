_Hi! I’m a [Bookaholic Belle](https://bookaholicbeller.com/). I’m a bookstagrammer and book blogger._ 

_I write about books I read, create reading lists just for fun, and share my takeaways from nonfiction books I read. I also write spoilers on my blog only when I think the book is not worth the time and money._ 

_I like to read romantic comedy books for more than a year now. It’s actually weird because years ago I wasn’t really a fan of rom-com books. I preferred mystery and thriller over romance back then._ 

_I’m a mood reader, meaning I choose my next read based on how I feel. So maybe someday, I’ll be back to reading mysteries and thrillers. For now my mood is in romantic comedy._

_You can find me on Instagram, or rather Bookstagram. I’m Bookaholic Belle there. If you have any good book recommendations, message me the title._
