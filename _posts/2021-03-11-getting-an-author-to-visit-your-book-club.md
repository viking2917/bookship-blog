Want to jazz up your book club meeting? Why not have the author join in?

Many people thing of authors as unreachable stars. Far from it. Many authors, even quite famous ones, will make time to visit your book club, especially if it's a virtual visit by Zoom. Being able to connect with the author of a book you love is a special experience. Checking their website is a good place to start - there's often an email address or contact form. Most authors seem to love hearing from readers, even if they can't make the meeting. If they can't do meetings, they usually will say so.

At Bookship, we're hoping to facilitate all of this. So we started a Meet the Author program, where we feature authors who are pre-confirmed to be available to join your meeting. There's a list of them below, and you can always find the complete and up to date list in the Bookship app or website.

We've [just added the capability](https://blog.bookshipapp.com/2021/03/11/%f0%9f%8e%a6%f0%9f%8e%ac%f0%9f%93%96-are-you-not-entertained-live-video-in-bookship-march-2021/) for live video chat RIGHT INSIDE BOOKSHIP!!!
