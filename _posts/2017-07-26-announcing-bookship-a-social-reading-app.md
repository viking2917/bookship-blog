Recently I had the chance to jointly read [Dune](http://email.mg.thehawaiiproject.com/c/eJxtjssKwyAUBb8m2SnXq9F04cISQn9DrUlsnhiL9O-b7gsHZjEwnKcWYnCujhqBKVDYsFYo4JQJ4Jzyu-kM3CQogy1gUwlYR5qnMNliYzzS_go-U7-v9aTBKwDH1IBWcfRSMCuw8VK2A1NtwHrRU87HWXFTYX-tlPK3dSm37_OF7r0FQtyHkD7ZbSaPkFxImRB2w0bWSa82zbTYPMftZNe7cbVx-TW-WPNB6g) with my son Erik, [Evicted](http://email.mg.thehawaiiproject.com/c/eJxtj81qBCEQhJ9m5qa0f6s5eDDZ5BbIK_i7Y2YdF0dW8vYx90A1XfBR3VTQnCfn1qwpEAmSCqK4BIYJB8YwezVXAy8XkIYqoGLhUG64b3Gzw-b8aPU7-o59LeumwYLzLFHPnGIhKeooF0r5FLwQ4SLXu956f5wLMwv9mBpj_HtrIlfrPtf7M_seA_qqz9j6D7LH9K2m3FE-0MwiU2LL3h7oLU-O3JxP2ycZ6BrPUmcAEaUYyLXpYtuOh-17Pk4yu9yKzfe_j7_QrVPh) with my daughter Kristen, and (gulp) [Thucydides](http://email.mg.thehawaiiproject.com/c/eJxtjksKwyAARE-T7BT_JgsXltJVl7mARlNtviQWye1rloXCwDDM8BinGBusraMiCEskCccNk4hCzBClkN70XaNWIKlJgwivGJpfMAUfTDYxbvv69n2C_TrXQZHeD1ZSLp3xTlDsBjtQ23IpGDGsEfWkQkrbUVFdkUdRzvkvq1R2XcdiXfDgaRY3m30EXfj0p4vOHwDYE_xk3rYc17u6hjCbNMblwOXtazZxuphfeltJTg) with a dear friend in Utah and one of my nephews. I reconnected with people I care about in a really meaningful way. I read books I wouldn’t have otherwise read and got more out of the books I would have read anyway. It was like our own private book club.

_Reading is better with friends._

Social media is awash in book-related content. Goodreads and Facebook reviews, Instagram photos (check out #bookstagram for a cuteness overload), #fridayreads on Twitter, the list goes on. But there’s no good place to _share the complete experience of reading a book_.

Sure, I can write a review on Goodreads when I’m done — and it will be lost in the ocean of other reviews there. And it’s after-the-fact anyway. By the time I’m done reading, I’ve forgotten most of my special moments or insights. Sure I can post on Facebook — but nobody has any context for why I’m posting, and it’ll be lost in the sea of noise that is Facebook. I may not even be friends with the people I want to share with.

Reading a book together is a unique way of strengthening a relationship or getting the most of out a book. It deserves a purpose-built, books-aware experience, where you can share your thoughts and reactions _as they happen,_ not two weeks later when you’re done with the book. An experience that creates companionship and context while you’re reading. An experience that helps you learn from other readers.

### Introducing Bookship.

[Bookship](https://www.bookshipapp.com) is a mobile app purpose-built for sharing your reading experiences with your family, friends and co-workers. Perfect for your book club, or just staying in touch with your friend across the country. Better still it _creates_ a reason for you to stay in touch with them! And it’s as easy as snapping a picture or posting a note.

Here’s a quick look at it in action:
