Welcome to 2019 from Bookship!

Starting this year we’ll be sending a monthly newsletter, to include:

- Product news
- Tips & Tricks
- Book news and recommendations.

This month’s news: Soon you’ll be able to read select **books for free right in the Bookship app**! Classics mostly to begin with (Dracula anyone? Treasure Island? Pride & Prejudice?). You can read along with friends and share comments right in the text (or just read for free by yourself!). Bookship will have a Kindle-like reader built right in. We’re excited to take social reading to the next level, and we’re looking for beta testers. If you’d like to try it out, just reply to this email and I’ll get you set up ([see it on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBT14fj1thY)).

**This month’s tip**: Notifications. Bookship sends notifications via email and phone alerts when people post. Sometimes, it’s too much. We get it. You can turn off either alerts or email or both, on the Accounts page. (Just remember, then you won’t know when your friends post!).

Bonus Tip: Bookship has a help page. Just go to the Account tab, top right, and hit the “?” icon.

The former First Lady’s memoirs were a big hit this month. In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address.

It tells the story of Celestial and Roy and their marriage, after Roy is convicted and imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. The New York Times called it “Haunting…Beautifully written”.
