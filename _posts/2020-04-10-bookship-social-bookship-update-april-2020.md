We hope you are staying safe and well during this challenging time.

Books educate us, they inspire and comfort us, they entertain us, they bind us together. Which is why I created Bookship: _Book_ relation_ships_. There's never been a better time to be reading, by yourself or with your friends and family.

With Bookship or not, we hope part of your routine is reading. Your library may be a great resource now, depending on where you live. We love the [Libby app](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/) (not all countries, unfortunately), with access to a wealth of free eBooks.

**This month's tip**: Too many Bookship emails? Go to Accounts, under Settings you can turn off email notifications, or app notifications, or both (but then you won't know when people post!).

A quick update on Bookship: we're exploring public social features for Bookship - like Instagram or Twitter, but for books. If you want to chime in, we have a survey going, it will take you about 2 minutes to finish:

Bookship has always been completely free, but that's not sustainable for the long term.

The basic product will remain free, but we're working on a (low cost) monthly subscription product, Bookship Premium, to help us keep Bookship alive. It doesn't feel like a great time to be asking for money, so the Premium version will be free for you, our existing customers, at least for some period of time. It will provide:  
  
Â  Â \* Access to a much-improved Bookship Briefings feature (the paper clip) for any book you're reading.  
Â  Â \* Readings and Groups with 10 or more people.  
Â  Â \* Guaranteed ad-free experience.  

Before it launches, we'll provide more details.

OK, on to the books! The most popular books on Bookship in the last 30 days are:

Not surprising people are reading it right now, I suppose. Mandel's book is ultimately hopeful (<em>at least I hope it is, I'm not done yet</em> ðŸ™‚ ).</span></td></tr></tbody></table>

It's also a movie starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle MonÃ¡e.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>
