So, I’m planning on going to see [Papa Hemingway in Cuba](https://g.co/kgs/8kNyF) this weekend. I was introduced to the topic of Hemingway in Cuba through the wonderful novel The Crook Factory, by Dan Simmons, which recounts Hemingway’s Cuba years. Did you know that Hemingway actually functioned as a spy during WWII? Me neither. Read the Crook Factory to learn more.

Here’s another thing you might not have known: Hemingway’s classic short story The Snows of Kilimanjaro was once read (and recorded) by Charlton Heston.

You can buy it from Amazon, but even better: you can listen to it for free here, along with other recordings….
