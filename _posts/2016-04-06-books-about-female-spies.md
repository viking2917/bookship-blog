Inspired by my reading [The Girl Who Fell From The Sky](http://www.thehawaiiproject.com/book/The-Girl-Who-Fell-from-the-Sky--by--Simon-Mawer--173201), the first espionage book I’ve read with a female protagonist, I did some research on books with female spies in them.

Literary star Ian McEwan weighs in with Sweet Tooth, probably the best known of the lot.

I learned a bit about this subject doing the research. Gayle Lynds was probably the first modern author to tackle this subject— she was early enough, this happened:

> the woman president of a New York publishing house at first agreed to buy her debut spy thriller, “Masquerade” — only to change her mind the next day. “Her reason? ‘No woman could have written this novel.’”

It’s a collaborative list, so if you know of some I missed you can add them to the list yourself!
