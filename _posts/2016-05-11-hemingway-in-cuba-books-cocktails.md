One more Hemingway post to follow the release of [Papa Hemingway in Cub](https://g.co/kgs/8kNyF)a, a movie about Hemingway’s time in Cuba. (our [first post here](https://medium.com/@thehawaiiproj/hemingway-in-cuba-1dcb3dad18f6#.yqgd4q5rf)).

Here’s a list of some great books about Hemingway and his life. Best read whilst sipping a Hemingway daiquiri. Not that frozen, slushy kind, the _real_ kind.

Recipe:

- **2** oz white rum (Havana Club if you got it)
- **3/4** oz fresh grapefruit juice
- **1/2** oz fresh lime juice
- **1/4** oz Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur
- **1/4** oz simple syrup 1:1
- Garnish with a grapefruit twist

There now. While you are sipping, check out this list:

A couple of my personal favorites:

As mentioned previously, **The Crook Factory** recounts Hemingway’s time in Cuba, when acted as a spy against the Nazis — seriously.

**To Have and to Have Another** — a Hemingway cocktail companion.

**Hemingway in Cuba**. A history of, well, Hemingway in Cuba.
