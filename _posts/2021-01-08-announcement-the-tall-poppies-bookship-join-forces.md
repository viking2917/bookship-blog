We are so excited to announce our partnership with the Tall Poppies Writers group, and their 10,000-strong Facebook discussion group [Bloom](http://areyouinbloom.com)!

As you know we recently announced our new [Meet the Authors](https://blog.bookshipapp.com/bookship-for-authors/) program, where Bookship reading groups can meet awesome authors live through video chats, for a more dynamic book club meeting! The [Tall Poppy Writers](https://tallpoppies.org/), a collective of 40+ female authors who include many New York Times Bestsellers, USA Today Bestsellers, and National Book Award Finalists in many genres, will make themselves available to Bookship reading groups, and will use Bookship as their official social reading app.

Readers who join the Bloom reading group get a free 3-month subscription to Bookship, and score free exclusive content. Check it out here: [http://areyouinbloom.com](https://t.co/GI5eHvS0Gl?amp=1).
