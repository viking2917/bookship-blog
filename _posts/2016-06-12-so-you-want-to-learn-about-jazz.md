The best way to learn about jazz is to listen to jazz. That said, put some jazz on your playlist WHILE you read some books about jazz.

Here’s a link to a [classic jazz playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/6XChIaijnUBzPDrQOX02AJ) on Spotify to get you started.

I went through a huge jazz phase, sparked by reading this novel: [In War Times](http://www.thehawaiiproject.com/book/In-War-Times--by--Kathleen-Ann-Goonan--33594), by Kathleen Ann Goonan. It’s a SF/Alternate history set in the early jazz age and talks a lot about the music. I made a playlist of the music mentioned in it: [In War Times (Kathleen Ann Goonan), a playlist by Mark Watkins on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/viking2917/playlist/7jZS1eOs4879cWN4dPqJgs). I think it’s really fun to work your way from early jazz to late jazz, learning along the way.

For non-fiction about Jazz, consider [But Beautiful](http://www.thehawaiiproject.com/book/But-Beautiful-A-Book-about-Jazz--by--Geoff-Dyer--20291) by Geoff Dyer or Max Gordon’s [stories from the Village Vanguard](http://www.thehawaiiproject.com/book/Live-At-The-Village-Vanguard-%28Da-Capo-Paperback%29--by--Max-Gordon--79908), the mecca of Jazz.
