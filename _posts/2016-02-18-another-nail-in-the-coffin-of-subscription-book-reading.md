Electric Literature reports:

We’ve written previously about [Scribd](https://medium.com/@thehawaiiproj/a-few-months-with-scribd-398b61cc6ac3#.tgyysyuvd) and the challenges of the ebook subscription model. Electric Lit reports that Scribd will more-or-less gut the service by imposing hard-to-understand limits on how much you can read on the service. It’s challenging enough to make an economic rationale for Scribd, in it’s current form ([as I wrote here](https://medium.com/@thehawaiiproj/a-few-months-with-scribd-398b61cc6ac3#.tgyysyuvd)). This will make it near-impossible.

I think it’s the endgame, until the publishers see this model as a benefit and revenue source, rather than as something to be tolerated.

What do you think?
