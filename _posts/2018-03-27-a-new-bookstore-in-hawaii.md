I was on my way to book club (the [Greener Reader](https://greenerreader.com/) book club), we were reading [Lagoon](https://www.thehawaiiproject.com/book/Lagoon--by--Nnedi-Okorafor--115082) by Nnedi Okorafor. Interesting, if erratic, alien “first contact” book set in Nigeria. I was early, and I’d seen a tweet there was a new bookstore in Kaimuki (it’s called da Shop), and I’ve never met a bookstore I didn’t like, so….

da Shop is sufficiently new that even Google Maps doesn’t know about it. It’s located underneath Bess Press at 3565 Harding Ave. I wandered til I found it, then wandered in. Turns out, they weren’t actually open yet. I had arrived while they were finishing setting up. They open tomorrow, and have [patagonia](https://medium.com/u/8b73ffab0d7) Ambassador Liz Clark talking about her book [Swell](https://www.thehawaiiproject.com/book/Swell-A-Sailing-Surfers-Voyage-of-Awakening--by--Liz-Clark--379970). If you’re in Hawaii and love books or surfing or sailing, you should go.

da Shop is one part Hawaiiana books and one part big 5 bestsellers. It is a small but elegant space, tastefully done up. Alas, no coffee as yet :) I was very happy to see a copy of Curve of the Hook, a stunningly beautiful and hard to find book of Polynesian Archaeology. Too bad they couldn’t sell it to me yesterday. Guess I have to go back.
