Hello from Bookship!

We hope you have been enjoying the Café, our first venture into a public social environment for Bookship. Many people (including me!) have begun participating in public readings, meeting new people, reading books they might not otherwise have read, and hopefully learning and experiencing new things.

We are hard at work on the next version of the Café - if you have feedback or things you'd like to see, please drop me a note.

To those of you who have subscribed to Bookship Premium, thank you. It is greatly appreciated! As a reminder, we donate 10% of our revenue right off the top to great literacy non-profits, including [Nabu.org](https://www.nabu.org/) (formerly Library For All, literacy in the developing world), and [HawaiiLiteracy.org](http://www.hawaiiliteracy.org/) (literacy here in Hawaii where we are based), so your money keeps Bookship going _and_ helps spread the love of Books.

**This month's tip**: Tired of notifications about a book you've already finished? Go to that Reading, and tap Done. The book will be removed from your active list (but always available via Account -> My Readings), and you will no longer be notified when others post about that book.

If you live in the United States ( and probably if you don't ), you are aware of the all-too-frequent injustice that is occurring. And looking for a way forward. Books, along with family, friends and faith, are where we turn for inspiration, for solace, for learning and growth. It's why I started Bookship. This month we feature works popular on Bookship that provide important perspectives at this time.

We can be a racist one minute and an anti-racist the next. What we say about race, what we do about race, in each moment, determines what - not who - we are....This book is ultimately about the basic struggle we're all in, the struggle to be fully human and to see that others are fully human.</em></span></td></tr></tbody></table>

I would be. <em>White Fragility</em> offers a different lens to think about the language and concepts of racism. As Claudia Rankine says, <em>“White Fragility brings language to the emotional structures that make true discussions about racial attitudes difficult. With clarity and compassion, DiAngelo allows us to understand racism as a practice not restricted to ‘bad people.’ In doing so, she moves our national discussions forward...”</em></span></td></tr></tbody></table>

Part memoir, part guidebook, Oluo relates her experiences growing up in Seattle as a person of color with a white mother, and uses her life experiences to ground these important conversations.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>
