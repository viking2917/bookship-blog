The Hawaii Project find great books you’d never find on your own. You can keep track of those books by hitting the “Want” button when you see it on a book you want to read.

Now, if you’re like me, your TBR list is out of control. Today, we’re introducing a new way to keep up with them, and get more information about them. You can read the latest stories that mention the books on your want lists — it might be a new review, or an article mentioning other books like it, or announcing that it won an award.

We make it as easy as clicking a link. Like this:

You can always find it in the News section of the site, under the Channels menu, “News about your Want List”.
