I have taken to reading a few pages of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations every morning as an antidote for all the everything going on (not just, or even foremost, politics). I highly recommend it for peace of mind. Today’s reading struck me, I thought I’d share. (Marcus Aurelius was a Roman emperor and the most powerful man in the world in his day, and he was writing notes to himself):

> People try to get away from it all — to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like.

> By going within.

> Nowhere you can go is more peaceful — more free of interruptions — than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony.

> So keep getting away from it all — like that. Renew yourself. But keep it brief and basic. A quick visit should be enough to ward off all < . . . > and send you back ready to face what awaits you.

> What’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior? But take into consideration: • that rational beings exist for one another; • that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience; • that no one does the wrong thing deliberately; • and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried.

> . . . and keep your mouth shut.

> Or are you complaining about the things the world assigns you? But consider the two options: Providence or atoms.

> …

> Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands.

> The people who praise us — how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space — and most of it uninhabited.

> …

> Above all, no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look at things like a man, like a human being, like a citizen, like a mortal. And among the things you turn to, these two: i. That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within — from our own perceptions.

> ii. That everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you’ve already seen.

> The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.

I particularly recommend (following [Ryan Holiday](https://medium.com/u/2e2701ae378f)) that you read the Gregory Hays translation.
