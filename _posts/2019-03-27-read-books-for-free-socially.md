This month we are very excited to announce a major new release of Bookship. Starting today, you can read classic works FOR FREE right inside Bookship. Great books like _Treasure Island_. _Dracula_. _Pride & Prejudice_. _The Complete King James Bible_. Classic mysteries like _The Hound of the Baskervilles_ or Adventure books like _The Count of Monte Cristo_ or _Captain Blood_. _Siddhartha_ by Herman Hesse.

Bookship now includes an eReader, with all the features you'd expect - bookmarks, highlighting, notes & annotation. And you can read _socially_ – sharing notes and comments with your friends right inside the text. This release has been months in the making and we can’t tell you how excited we are about it. We hope you are too. Just look for the Read Free! tag on the book covers or browse the Read Free! categories.

Bookship lets you read tens of thousands of books for free, and read them _socially_ - sharing your comments with your friends right inside the book. Our eBooks are in ePub format and generously provided through the good work of, and under the terms of, [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:The_Project_Gutenberg_License), [Standard eBooks](https://standardebooks.org/about/), and [The University of Adelaide](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/). We are not affiliated with those entities and do not claim they endorse our work (although we hope they like it!). You can download any book you find in Bookship directly from those sites as well, and use them in the eReader of your choice. We're grateful to those projects for making some of the world's greatest literature available in an unrestricted way.

If you want to see it in action, here's a short video of a group read.
