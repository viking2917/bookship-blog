Ever been looking a cool web page mentioning a bunch of books you want to remember?

The TBR Bookmarker chrome extension is just the thing!

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/TBRBookmarker1-1024x640.png)

The TBR Book Bookmarker finds books mentioned on web pages, and lets you save them for later. It's like a Trapper/Keeper for books. You can also click out to the book's Bookshop.org or Amazon page, or tap the book to read a description.

To install, go here: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tbr-bookmarker-extension/fmejmbhmojmdkbdincpdemceagieomjl](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tbr-bookmarker-extension/fmejmbhmojmdkbdincpdemceagieomjl) or go to the Chrome webstore and search for "TBR Bookmarker".

This extension is a companion for the [TBR Booklist Tracker app](https://tbrapp.co). Books you save here are also tracked in the app, and vice versa. But you do not need the app to use this extension.

Bookmarker "reads" the text of the web page you are on, figures out which books are mentioned, and gives you a beautiful little window with all the cover art for the books shown. You can "bookmark" those books, and they'll go in your trapper/keeper of books. You can come back to them any time.

Come back to Bookmarker any time, hit the "gear" button, and hit "TBR list" and you'll see the books you've been saving away. Your To Be Read list.

Enjoy!
