In case you have been hiding under a rock and don’t know what a chatbot is, it’s a service where you communicate via written or spoken words and sentences, rather than clicking menu items in a browser.

We’re in the early stages of testing our Book chatbot. In our case, you send messages to us via Facebook messenger (go to [http://m.me/thehawaiiproject](http://m.me/thehawaiiproject) or [https://www.facebook.com/thehawaiiproject](https://www.facebook.com/thehawaiiproject)) and start messaging us.

You can find great gift ideas for the holidays, or for yourself. There’s a few “modalities” — you can tell us what your recipient is interested in or what kind of books they read, you can tell us the name of a book you loved and we’ll recommend good followon books. Or you can ask us what’s popular right now (with more capabilities on the way).

A sample interaction might look something like this:

It’s early days for our bot, but we hope you can give it a go. It’s powered by The Hawaii Project’s recommendation engine, which knows about hundreds of thousands of great books. Every conversation you have with it helps us make it better.
