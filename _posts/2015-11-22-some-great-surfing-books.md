While I’m not a surfer, I’ve always had a fascination with the sport. The mystical side of being in the ocean, the raw physicality of the sport, and the counter-culture and sub-culture of people who surf.

Here’s a list of some of my favorite books about surfing.

Tapping the Source is the classic surfer novel. Kem Nunn more or less invented the genre.

The Dogs of Winter might be my favorite. Kem Nunn does surfer noir like nobody’s business.

Here’s a look at the dark underbelly of surfer culture, set in Hawaii’s North Shore.

Here’s a more positive view — the story of Eddie Aikau, Hawaiian hero.
