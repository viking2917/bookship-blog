I was in a Barnes & Noble the other day, and noticed something interesting.

There’s no section in the store focused on the Election! You’d think, with Super Tuesday and everything, there’d be a big section at the front of the store with books from Trump, Clinton, Sanders and the rest, as well as books from the chattering classes.

But no. And, Amazon didn’t have one either!

I guess maybe they are afraid of the controvery.

Well not us. In honor of Super Tuesday, we give you our Election Year books!

Trump, Clinton, Sanders, and the rest. Our recommended reading for the election. Enjoy. Vote!
