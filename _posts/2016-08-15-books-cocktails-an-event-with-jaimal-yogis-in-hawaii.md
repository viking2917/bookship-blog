If you are in Hawaii and love books and/or cocktails, please come to this event! It’s the kickoff event for [Books & Spirits](http://www.booksandspirits.com), the new event series we’ve created in collaboration with [Stuart Coleman,](https://medium.com/u/c8fae55b06e7) author of Eddie Would Go, Fierce Heart, and Eddie Aikau: Hawaiian Hero.

The first event is Thursday Aug 18th, at Revolusun Smart Home in Honolulu. We’ll be interviewing Jaimal Yogis, the author of Saltwater Buddha and The Fear Project.
