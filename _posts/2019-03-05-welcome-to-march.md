**This month's tip**: Sharing Quotes. Sometimes a quote really strikes you and you want to share it with your fellow readers. Good news: there's three ways to do that with Bookship; none of them involve typing it all in.

- In our new eReader, just highlight the text right on the page, then either Keep Highlight or Create Note. Either way, your reading friends will see your highlight.
- In your Kindle app, highlight the text you want, then hit your Share menu (iPhone and Android do this differently but both work. Share the highlight to Bookship and Presto! it will show up in your comments.
- If you're reading a physical book, go to the Bookship comment menu and hit Extract Text from Image. Take a picture of your page, swipe your thumb over the text you want to highlight in yellow, and presto again you'll get your quote.

[Tower of Dawn](https://www.amazon.com/Tower-Dawn-Throne-Glass-Book-ebook/dp/B01M8NHXGH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=ll1&tag=codexmap-20&linkId=35c123b37b8caa8f464c95becc854130&language=en_US)

Tower of Dawn, the next installment in the wildly popular Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas, is our second most popular book this month. Chaol Westfall has always defined himself by his unwavering loyalty, his strength, and his position as the Captain of the Guard. But all of that has changed since the glass castle shattered, since his men were slaughtered, since the King of Adarlan spared him from a killing blow, but left his body broken.

[Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Throne](https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Sorcerers-Stone-Book/dp/0545582881%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIKMVYJ6MJU6ROZYQ%26tag%3Dcodexmap-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0545582881)

A lot of people on Bookship are reading (or re-reading) the first book in the classic Harry Potter series. Sometimes a great book becomes so much the better when you share it with friends, and Harry Potter must certainly be one of the most "socially read" books around. To those reading, we hope you're enjoying it. To those who aren't, isn't there someone in your life you should read this book again with on Bookship? ðŸ˜€ðŸ“–

We hope you get a chance to read some great books for free with our new version of Bookship. Please let us know how it goes!

Happy Reading!

P.s. If you are enjoying Bookship, it would mean a ton to us if you'd leave a rating and review in your App Store. It helps so much!
