[![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/4d8b7-1sb5rdx08-lk6xcklmkh_ka-300x187.png)Bookship](https://www.bookshipapp.com) is a social reading app for sharing your reading experiences with friends, family and co-workers. It’s great for sharing thoughts, comments, photos and quotes while you read. And the mobile form factor means it’s always with you, whether you’re reading on the couch, the plane or the train. Mobile notifications keep you up to date as your friends comment. Available on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1249506408?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.bookship&referrer=utm_source%3Dbsaweb) and [Kindle FireOS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07668X1KF/ref=mas_pm_Bookship_book_club_reading_friends), it’s on pretty much any mobile device.

And yet, sometimes you need to type out a long form comment, or cut and paste a bunch of things from other websites, or just see it all on a nice big screen.

Today we’re pleased to announce that Bookship is also available as a responsive website, so you can fire it up in your browser, on your desktop, laptop, or for that matter your phone’s browser.

This makes is easy to type in longer comments with your keyboard, as well as surf the web looking for relevant articles and share them with your friends, or just read in the comfort of a big screen. We find this format is particularly useful for educational uses — students may not all have access to a mobile phone, or may need to draft longer, more substantive comments on what they’re reading.

Give it a go and let us know what you think!
