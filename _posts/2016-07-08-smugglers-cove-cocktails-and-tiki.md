You know we love a good book here at The Hawaii Project.

You’re pretty sure we love a good cocktail.

Since we’re all about Hawaii and Books, you can guess Tiki culture is in the picture.

Today’s trifecta, the triple crown, the perhaps all-time-best match between us and a book has arrived.

Smuggler’s cove, the famous tiki bar in San Francisco, has a book out. OMG. Stop the presses.

In amazing coincidence, we find ourselves in San Francisco on the day we found out about this book. Synchronicity.

We’ll report back after our visit. If we can remember what happened.
